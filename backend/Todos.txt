-> gottem-> https://www.trumba.com/s.aspx?hosted2=1&editmode&calendar=sacramento-state-events&widget=main&index=100&spudformat=xhr&events=50%25 <- the 50 here represents the number of events, range is 50-1000
-> this ones fetches in json but only the next 50 events with no pagination possible -> https://www.trumba.com/calendars/sacramento-state-events.json
-> don't ask how I got this, it involved summoning a Council of Delphic Oracles... also hacking
-> will prob make a scrapper helper tha paginates the events from the first link into nicely formatted json 50 events at a time
-> helper will take in a data and return 50 events from that date onward, then flutter needs to autofetch on scroll.
-> might need to do calendar nav so it's not just a giant list scroll.
